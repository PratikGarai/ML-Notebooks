# Central Measures

## Population $(N)$
The overall data.

### Population Mean $(\mu) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{x_i}{N}$

## Sample $(n)$
A subset of the data (without repitition).

### Sample Mean $(\bar{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i}{n}$


# Central Tendency

Refers to the measure used to determinethe center the distribution of the data.

1. Mean
    - Average of the values
    - Sensitive to outliers
2. Meadian 
    - Center of the sorted data points
    - Not sensitive to outliers (roubust)
3. Mode
    - Most frequent element

## Relationship between central tendencies
$$ Mean - Mode = 3 * (Mean - Median) $$
