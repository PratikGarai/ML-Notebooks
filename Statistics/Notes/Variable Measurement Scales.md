# Variable Measurement Scales

## 1. Nominal data

- Categorical data, which can be distributed into classes.
- Examples : Gender, Flower type, Color.



## 2. Ordinal data

- Order of the data matters, value does not.
- Example : Rank of students in a class based on marks. We are concerned about the placement of the student in the class, the value of marks scored does not matter.



## 3. Interval Data

- Order matters, value matters.
- Natural zero is not present. They have an arbitrary 0, i.e. the place were zero appears on the scale was chosen for convenience not because it represents a true absence of the thing being measured.  So there is no concept of a ratio between two numbers or the ability to  multiply or divide two numbers in any meaningful way.
- Example : Temperature [ (0-10), (10-20), (20-30), (30-40), .... ]



## 4. Ratio Data
