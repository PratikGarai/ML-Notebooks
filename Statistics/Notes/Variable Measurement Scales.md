# Variable Measurement Scales

## 1. Nominal data

- Categorical data, which can be distributed into classes.
- Examples : Gender, Flower type, Color.



## 2. Ordinal data

- Order of the data matters, value does not.
- Example : Rank of students in a class based on marks. We are concerned about the placement of the student in the class, the value of marks scored does not matter.



## 3. Interval Data

- Order matters, value matters.
- Natural zero is not present. They have an arbitrary 0, i.e. the place were zero appears on the scale was chosen for convenience not because it represents a true absence of the thing being measured.  So there is no concept of a ratio between two numbers or the ability to  multiply or divide two numbers in any meaningful way.
- Example : Temperature in Celsius [ (0-10), (10-20), (20-30), (30-40), .... ]
- The difference between 20°C and 30°C (which is a 10° change) is the same difference in temperature as a change from 40° to 50° (also a 10°  change). So we can perform addition and subtraction with this interval  scale.
- However, it doesn’t make sense to say that 20°C is half as hot as 40°C  or that 40°C is twice as hot as 20°C. This is because 0°C isn’t the  absence of all heat but rather was an arbitrarily chosen point on the  scale where water freezes.



## 4. Ratio Data

- Type of numerical data.
- Ratio scales do have a natural (non-arbitrarily chosen) zero point. So  the concept of a ratio, and multiplying or dividing two values make  perfect sense.
- Example : Mass of apples in grams (0-100, 100-200, 200-300, ....)
- Imagine we have two apples: One has a mass of 100 grams and the other  has a mass of 200 grams. Unlike an interval scale, it make perfect sense to say that a 100-gram apple is half the mass of a 200-gram apple. This is because zero grams on this scale represents a natural minimum  quantity (i.e. no mass at all). So 200 grams of mass is twice as much  mass as 100 grams of mass.
