# Inferential Statistics



## Population (N)

The entire sample space.



## Sample (n)

A subset of population taken in for computation.



## Sampling Techniques

### 1. Simple Random sampling

- Randomly select "n" samples from the population. 
- Equal chance of selection to all members for the sample.



### 2. Stratified sampling

- Population(N) is divided into **non-overlapping** groups based on a property/condition. These groups are called **strata**.
- **Valid example of strata condition** : Age. If we divide population into age limits of (1-10), (11-20), (21-30), ... etc, there is no person that can fall under more than group. So no overlap occurs.
- **Invalid example of strata** : Skillset. If we divide population into skillset of Python, Java, C++, JS, .... etc, there can be people that can have more than one of these skills, so they fall under more than one group, creating overlap.



### 3. Systematic sampling

- From the population, select **every k-th member** to create the sample.
- Example : Ask a question to every 8th person exiting a building.



### 4. Convenience sampling

- Select only members that have domain knowledge regarding the topic of experiment.
- Example : Programming language related survey inputs taken only from developers.
